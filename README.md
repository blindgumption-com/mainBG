# Original Blindgumption - 2023-09-01

I have a bur in my saddle and am getting ready to really do something with [blindgumption.com](https://blindgumption.com).
I have copied the original static HTML pages to
[my github pages site](https://joeldodson.github.io/mainBlindGumptionOriginalContent/index.html).
I've left the README as it was as of this commit, but I have changed the repo name to original-blindgumption.
Now it's time to archive this repo and go boldly into the future.

# main-blindgumption

the main repository for blindgumption.com.  This will likely be the jumping off point for all things BlindGumption. 

## Branches 
###master 
what is served from https://blindgumption.com 

### usingJinja
currently (2021-02-08), blindgumption.com is all static HTML served directly from Nginx.
usingJunjs is a project to change that.

I'll be using Python/flask to serve blindgumption.com 
and jinja to templatize the content to get rid of the duplicated HTML.
