# main-blindgumption
the main repository for blindgumption.com.  This will likely be the jumping off point for all things BlindGumption. 

## Branches 
###master 
what is served from https://blindgumption.com 

### usingJinja
currently (2021-02-08), blindgumption.com is all static HTML served directly from Nginx.
usingJunjs is a project to change that.

I'll be using Python/flask to serve blindgumption.com 
and jinja to templatize the content to get rid of the duplicated HTML.
