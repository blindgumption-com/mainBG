		<h1>Creating and Configuring the Initial Webserver for blindgumption.com</h1>
		<p>
			We're going to go through several tutorials from DigitalOcean to get the server configured.
I chose DigitalOcean due to its somewhat accessible user interface.  I say somewhat becuase you have to poke around to find information.  It could be a much better user experience, I have been able to do everything I've needed/wanted to do though and that's much better than some other cloud services (yes, I'm referring to AWS). 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll avoid going into detail on using the DigitalOcean console.  It appears to be evolving as I'm using it.  I don't recall the changes but do recall thinking they were improvements and I know they're working on accessibility.  Hopefully a future reader here will find DigitalOcean to be a very smooth interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will however give a few pointers on the current (Sept 2020) DigitalOcean UI.  Once I log in to my account, I press 'b' to find either the manage or create button, depending on what I need to do. Pressing buttons in DigitalOcean often results in silence.  That generally implies something was opened in a frame somwhere and you'll need to find it.
			For activities like createing or managing droplets or domains, I find pressing '1' to go to the first level header, or 't' to go to the next table will get me where I need to be.    
		</p>

		<h2>Creating the Initial Server</h2>
		<p>
			In DigitalOcean, the virtual machines are called droplets.  To create a droplet, that's right, find the create button.  
		</p>
		<p>
			After pressing create, the link to create a new droplet is (at least as of Sept, 2020) immediately below the button.  Click the link to create a new droplet then find the first header and follow the directions.
		</p>
		<p> 
	 What type of droplet should you create?  If your new to most of this, I suggest Ubuntu with the lowest resources (CPU, storage, RAM).  It's only $5/month and will be plenty to get going.  Ubuntu is very common so you'll probably find a lot of answers online if/when you run into problems.  blindgumption.com is currently running on Ubuntu 20.04LTS.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll be asked several questions to create the droplet.  If this is your first time, I suggest don't worry about a backup or extra storage or IPv6 .  I chose the SF region since I'm on the West Coast for where to create the droplet.  You might want to choose a region near you.  It only matters in the possible delay between you and the datacenter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless you already know about SSH keys, create a root user password which you'll use in subsequent steps.  There's a link further down explaining how to create SSH keys and upload them to your host.
		</p>
		<p>
			What should my hostname be?  If you have already 
			<a href="/notes/developingBG/creatingTheDomain.html">created a domain</a>a> (we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem), you might want to give your new droplet a name like, "home.mydomain.com" during this creation process.  Don't worry if you don't have a name yet, you can set it later (there's a link below).  You will need to know the IP address though to log in to the host in the next steps.
		</p>
		<h3>I have to use a VPC?</h3>
		<p>
			A VPC is a 
			<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/vpc/">Virtual Private Cloud.</a>
			A VPC is a way to organize resources wihtin a cloud environment for isolation and better security.  There are many benefits to a VPC which you can read about on DigitalOcean.
		</p>
		<p></p> 
			As I'm writing this (Sept. 2020) droplets do not have to be created within a VPC.  That is changing in October.  The apps.blindgumption.com, the name of the webserver for blindgumption.com is a single droplet, not in a VPC.  If BlindGumption takes off in any large sense, I'll convert to a VPC.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're reading this and I have not taken the time to update the article with how to use a VPC, hopefully there are some clear defaults that let you have a droplet in a VPC with a publically accessible IP address.  If you see the term gateway, that's generally a host on the edge of the VPC, between the private and public networks.  Hopefully the default is to create your new droplet as a gateway.  Then the VPC will likely be transparent to you.

		<h2>Initial Server Configuration</h2>
		<p>
		 See this <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">
			DigitalOcean tutorial for adding users, setting up SSH keys, and initializing a firewall.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			that tutorial is complete though you'll need to click through a link in the tutorial to get to the SSH tutorial.  Don't be intimidated by the idea of generating and using SSH keys.  They will make your life easier and it's just a matter of following the directions.  And if you're getting into tech, you'll really want to start understanding security.
		</p>
		<p>
			Regarding UFW, the firewall used in the tutorial.  It's not going to break anything if you don't use a firewall, but it's a good practice and it's easy to configure.  I recommend doing those steps. 
		</p>

		<h2>Install and Configure Nginx, the Webserver</h2>
		<p>
			We have a server with a user with sudo privileges, time to install a webserver.  Nginx is a very popular option and, you guessed it, there's a good
