		<h1>How BlindGumption is Developed and Managed </h1>
<p>
This area of BlindGumption contains notes loosely based on the theme of how the 
BlindGumption site itself was created, how it continues to evolve, and how it is being managed.
Articles range from the intial creation of the domain and hosts, 
to how the code is managed and tasks tracked, 
to deployment of new code and management of the platform. 
</p>  
<p>
Each article will be marked by an h2 heading.  The heading itself is a link to the article.  After the heading is a very brief description of the article.  
</p>
<p>
	The articles are not tutorials. 
	Each article is intended to address a specific topic or a few closely related topics.
	Ideally there will be enough links in the article for the reader to follow and learn more about the topic.
	Hopefully the article with the links and some self motivated searching will lead the reader to a deeper understanding of the topic.
</p>
<h2>The Creation Steps are Somewhat Interdependent </h2>
<p>
	This section is arranged to highlite the small interdependence between creating the domain and creating the host that will be the webserver.  The domain can be created before the host and vice versa.  The interdependence is the IP address needed to create an 'A' and/or 'AAAA' record in the domain.  There are details in the two creating articles, hopefully it's clear. 
</p>
<h3><a href="/notes/developingBG/creatingTheDomain.html">The Creation of the blindgumption.com Domain</a></h3>
<p>
this describes the process of getting the domain name blindgumption.com, creating the domain, and pointing it to the correct webserver.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note:</em>  You don't have to have a domain and URL to access your server.  You can skip this section and simply use an IP address whereever you would otherwise type in the domain name (e.g., in the browser's address bar). 
</p>
<p>
	<em>That said...</em> I recommend getting a domain name and creating your domain.  It's not hard and will make this overall exercise more interesting and more fun than typing an IP address, especially if you want to use IPv6.
</p>

<h3><a href="/notes/developingBG/creatingTheWS.html">Creating and Configuring the Webserver</a></h3>
<p>
	This article contains details of the creation and configuration of the host that is the webserver delivering the content for BlindGumption.
